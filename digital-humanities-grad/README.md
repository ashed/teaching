# LLCU-602: Digital Humanities (Fall 2017)
Instructor: Prof. S. Sinclair (@sgsinclair)<br>
Seminars Mondays from 1pm to 3:30pm in SH688, room 485<br>
Office Hours: Mondays noon-1pm or by appointment

## Summary
The Humanities are rich from centuries of intellectual practices and millennia of historical records and thought. The Digital Humanities seek to engage with those traditions while also exploring the potential for using digital technologies to extend modes of humanistic inquiry. What new interpretations might be spawned when bits of cultural data can be infinitely rearranged into representations unimaginable in analogue form? What new arguments might be proposed when we can instantly ask questions at the unprecedented scale of millions of books? Through a mix of seminar discussions, hands-on tutorials, and project-based work, this course will provide students with theoretical and practical foundations for working in the Digital Humanities, covering topics such as digitization, encoding, analysis, and visualization. No technical background is required.

## Outcomes
By the end of the course students should
* be able to describe the essential characteristics of the digital humanities as a discipline
* be familiar with a wide range of tools and techniques for digital humanities scholarship
* have expertise in using a set of tools effectively to enhance their own research

* have experience in planning and implementing a digital project

## Resources
Most course readings are taken from _Doing Digital Humanities: Practice, Training, Research_ (more information will be provided in class). Beyond that the course will rely heavily on open access and open source resources.

## Evaluation
* (15%) My Grad Studies Project, A Creative Vignette: Describe the essence of your grad studies project (dissertation, thesis, or overarching objective for course-based programs) in a two-minute video intended for a very broad audience (we will discuss story-boarding and video production in class). Vignettes will be assessed for creativity and effectiveness.
* (20%) Presentation: Each student will choose one of the weekly readings and examine the references section to determine an additional reading that would be useful to present to the class (part of the mark will be how well the choice of the supplemental reading is justified). Presentations must make significant use of a digital technology, but may not use slideware (PowerPoint, Keynote, Impress, etc.). Alternatives include Prezi, Xtranormal, and multimedia videos. Students will be assessed on the quality and usefulness of the information presented, as well as the effectiveness of the use of the chosen communication platform.
* (15%) Curated Readings: Students will peruse the abstracts from the [Digital Humanities 2017](https://dh2017.adho.org/program/abstracts/) conference to identify two readings that are of particular relevance for their graduate work. Each entry to should follow the template of the [curated artefacts](https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/!template-skeleton.md#curated-artifacts-ten-artifacts-each-with-metadata-a-screenshot-and-a-150-word-annotation) from the [Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models and Experiments](https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/description.md) volume (students are strongly encouraged to browse the [keywords](https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/tree/master/keywords) to view examples). 
* (20%) Final Project Proposal, A Conference Poster Proposal: Students will formulate a proposal for their final project in the form of a short, text-based conference proposal. Proposals should clearly describe the project and provide adequate scholarly context for the work being done. Proposals can be done in teams.
* (20%) Final Project, A Poster Presentation: Students will create a poster that will summarize the essential components of their final project, including the scholarly context, the achievements and insights, and the relevant technical aspects. Students should carefully consider the poster genre and their choices for expression. Each project will have 5-10 minutes for the poster presentation, followed by some time for discussion. Assessment will focus on the strengths of the project and the effectiveness of the poster. Projects can be done in teams.
* (10%) Participation: Student attendance and participation in seminar discussions is a crucial component of the class.

## Policies
* This course is a mix of theory and practice â€“ students are expected to attend and participate thoughtfully and respectfully in the seminar meetings. Students must bring a laptop to class to participate in the hands-on components.
* The Course Management System will be used extensively in this class to post notes, important date changes, assignment descriptions, etc. You are responsible for checking the site regularly (at least twice a week) for any changes or updates.
* In accord with McGill University's Charter of Students' Rights, you may submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded. Please be aware that impeccable grammar is required whether you choose to write in French or in English.
* McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/ for more information). Please note that multimedia objects (images, video, etc.) as well as programming code are subject to the same standards of academic integrity.
