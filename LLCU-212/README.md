## Description

*Know thyself* is a millenia-old maxim that encourages us to continuously seek a better understanding of who we are, including our strengths and limitations. Digital technologies have become deeply intertwined in our individual and collective identities, which begs the question: What do we know about ourselves in this digtal age? Lectures will explore a range of topics related to technologies of contemporary digital and social media, with particular attention to understanding technical, historical, social, ethical and legal issues. Tutorials will help students to express themselves effectively with digital media, and especially on the web (HTML, CSS, images, audio, video).
