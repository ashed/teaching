	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Digital texts are composed of discrete units of information that
		have the virtue of being infinitely malleable and reconfigurable,
		allowing new practices for searching, filtering, comparing,
		annotating, measuring, representing and understanding texts. From
		single works to virtual libraries, from canonical classics to
		contemporary social media, digital texts can provide rich fodder for
		interpretive practices in the digital humanities. This course will
		provide students with practical foundations for
		studying and interpreting a variety of digital texts.</p>
	<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
	<p>By the end of this course students should be able to</p>
	<ul>
		<li>compile and prepare for analysis a variety of types of
			digital texts</li>
		<li>use text analysis and statistical software to study digital
			texts</li>
		<li>produce visualizations from analytic and statistical data</li>
		<li>think algorithmically about digital texts</li>
		<li>navigate between close and distant reading practices</li>
		<li>describe and demonstrate the value and limitations of digital
			methodologies</li>
		<li>have some expertise and experience in learning new technical
			skills, especially using web resources</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Course Content</h2>
	<p>This is essentially a course on computationally-mediate text analysis
		from humanistic perspectives. Considerable time and
		effort will be devoted to learning new digital methodologies. Students
		need not have any technical background, but students do need to be
		thoroughly committed to learning new skills that will require abundant
		perseverance and resourcefulness. The primary purposes of this course
		are to learn to think algorithmically about digital texts and to
		explore what interpretive and hermeneutic practices are enabled by
		digital methodologies (learning technical skill are a means to those
		ends). The course is organized into a set of modules but don't necessarily
		correspond to a weekly schedule, we will proceed at a pace that works for
		the class.</p>

	<h2>Instructional Method</h2>
	<p>This course is a graduate seminar that is a mix of discussion
		and hands-on workshop.</p>
	<h2>Course Materials</h2>
	<p>There are no materials to purchase for this course, all
		materials (weekly readings, tutorials, exercises, etc.) will be made
		available in digital format through the course website. Students need
		to have a laptop computer with them during every class.</p>
